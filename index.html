Welcome to my site. The sole purpose for why I created this site is to inform those about the interesting world of D&D to the best of my ability 
and just how creative one can get in making their own characters, using said characters in battling various monsters, 
and coming up with all sorts of interesting scenarios. In advance, I apologize if I leave something out or if something seems confusing. 
I'm still kinda new to the game itself, but I greatly enjoy it with my friends and I. I also apologize for grammar mistakes. 
Those are bound to appear given how much effort I put into writing this sites information. But hopefully they aren't frequent.

<h1>How to Start</h1>
<br/>
<p>
The main lure about D&D is that it is a game fueled primarily by one's own imagination and putting that imagination onto paper
 (or in text or through words, though you'd probably prefer the former), basically it's a form of RPing 
 (role-playing) that involves RPG elements and theoretically it can be played anywhere if you have internet access, 
 can connect to a chat-room (I'd recommend using the discord app for mobile devices), 
 a D&D dice-roller (like this one https://www.wizards.com/d20modern/d20mdice/dice.htm, although you could invite a D&D bot to your discord server), 
 and some pals to play with.<br/> <br/>

The next step is for the group to come up with a plot for the RP, although usually the GM (Game Master) has a plot prepped already. Basically, 
it's like writing a story that is overall affected by the actions made by the players in order to reach their varied goals. 
Players usually start out by writing about what their characters are doing or introducing them within the party. 
Typically the direction of the plot is handled by the GM, who has full rain over all events that could occur within 
the RP as the characters strive to reach their goal.<br/><br/>

There will be many occurrences where players may be asked to 
roll dice to see who attacks first, how much damage their character deals, 
if they can avoid falling into a ditch, if their attacks hit (or if they get hit
 themselves), or if they successfully convince a pig that pork tastes delicious and so on. You'll 
 find much more information on how to play on the character creation page. <br/>
