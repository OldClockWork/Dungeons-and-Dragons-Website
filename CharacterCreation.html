<p>Unlike most RPG's, D&D comes with two new features to stats which are Armor Points and Skills.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>Armor Points (AC) basically determine with either or not characters end up taking damage from an attack. 
Before taking damage, the attacker must roll a 1d20 (a dice with 20 sides). 
If the number surpasses the targets AC then the target takes damage, if it fails then the attack either misses or is blocked. 
The average joe usually has a base AC of 10 though this can be higher or weaker depending on stats and armor worn.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>Next are skills, and there are quite a few of them being:</p>
<br/><br/>

<ul class="stats">
   <li>Acrobatics</li>
   <li>Animal Handling</li>
   <li>Arcana</li>
   <li>Athletics</li>
   <li>Deception</li>
   <li>History</li>
   <li>Insight</li>
   <li>Intimidation</li>
   <li>Investigation</li>
   <li>Medicine</li>
   <li>Nature</li>
   <li>Perception </li>
   <li>Performance</li>
   <li>Persuasion</li>
   <li>Religion</li>
   <li>Sleight of Hand</li>
   <li>Stealth</li>
   <li>Survival</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<p>This might seem a tad overwhelming, but trust me once you get the hang of the game it's much simpler then you may think. 
I could explain what each skill does, but I'll just explain the ones that aren't self explanatory.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>Sleight of Hand: Basically determines a character's ability in snatching something without anyone noticing.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Performance: Determines just how good of a show you put on for people, perhaps in order to distract or maybe get some sort of reward out of it such as money.</p> 
<br/><br/>
<p>Religion: Measures your characters ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, 
holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Arcana: Measures your characters ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, 
magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Nature: Measures your character ability to recall lore about the terrain, plants, and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>History: Measures your characters ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, 
past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Survival: Handles a characters ability to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide their group through wild environments, 
identify signs that certain creatures live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Investigation: Determines if a character is able to recognize traps, figure out the causes of wounds, and finding clues 
and hidden objects. Bare in mind this may seem kinda smiler to perception, but they are different with perception measuring 
if a character spots, hears, or otherwise detect the presence of something.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Insight: Decides whether your character can determine the true intentions of a creature, 
such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>The main role of skills is to attach bonus points to certain rolls fitting of the skill, like trying to calm down a horse 
will require rolling a 1d20 plus the bonus modifier from Animal handling or if your character is trying to look for a bandit 
hiding out in some trees then it will involve another 1d20 but this time adding your characters Perception modifier to spot them.
 On some occasions, you may need to roll 1d20 and add the bonus modifier from one of your stats instead from one of your skills.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>Skill are further improved depending on a character's stats with specific skills being connected to specific stats. 
You can see what skills are tied to what stats by looking at the cloumb blow:</p>
<br/><br/>

<ul class="stats">
<li><a>Strength</a>: Athletics</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<ul class="stats">
<li><a>Dexterity</a>: Sleight of Hand, Acrobatics, Stealth</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<ul class="stats">
<li><a>Intelligence</a>: Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<ul class="stats">
<li><a>Wisdom</a>: Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<ul class="stats">
<li><a>Charisma</a>: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<p>These skills are further enhanced or worsened depending on a stats modifier. 
The average persons has 10 points in each of their respected stats, but this doesn't add any modifiers 
(keep in mind points and modifier are different). If a person were to say have an INT of 12 then that would add +1 modifier bonus, 
if it were an 8 then it's a -1. Basically, bonus modifiers are added or decrease by 1 per 2 points above or below 10.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>Most creatures and characters cannot have stats with points beyond 20, though some monsters and certain classes can defy this rule.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>If you've played an RPG before you should be well aware that characters come with stats such 
as HP (Hit-points) and STR (strength) and what those stats mean. In D&D characters have</p>
<br/><br/>

<ul class="stats">
   <li>STR (Strength)</li>
   <li>DEX (Dexterity)</li>
   <li>CON (Consitution)</li>
   <li>INT (Intelligence)</li>
   <li>WIS (Wisdom)</li>
<li>and CHA (Charisma).</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<p>If you are fully aware what these stats mean, as they aren't any different in 
other RPG game, then you can just skip this piece of information. 
For those who aren't familiar I shall explain further.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Strength: measures a character's physical power, adding bonuses to damage output 
with physical weapons and the chance hit with them. 
It also determines just how much a character is able to carry.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Dexterity: measures a character's agility, adding bonuses to weapons that benefit from dexterity such as a 
shortsword or daggers. It can also add bonus modifiers to certain mediam and light armor.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Constitution: adds bonus hit-points that are * your characters current level. </p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma: Each of these cold add bonus hit-points to magic depending on class.</p>
<br/><br/>

<h1>Races</h1>
<p>D&D comes with a vast number of different playable races which include, but are not limited to Humans, Orcs, Goblins, Gnomes, Hobbits, 
Changelings, Elves, Half-orcs, Half-elves, Centaurs, and still many, many more to choose. And each race has its own set of unique feats to 
benefit from.</p>
<br/><br/>

<h1>Classes</h1>

<p>D&D has a total of 12 different classes. These classes are:</p>
<br/><br/>
<ul class="stats">
   <li>Barbarian (Tank/Offence)</li>
   <li>Bard (Support)</li>
   <li>Cleric (Healer)</li>
   <li>Druid (Healer/Offence)</li>
   <li>Fighter (Offence)</li>
   <li>Monk (Offence)</li>
   <li>Paladin (Tank)</li>
   <li>Ranger (Offence)</li>
   <li>Rogue (Offence)</li>
   <li>Sorcery (Offence)</li>
   <li>Warlock (Offence/Tank kinda)</li>
   <li>Wizard (Offence)</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<p>
Not only that, but each of these classes come with their own unique sub-classes which are usually picked at level 3.
 Much like any RPG, each class has its own strengths and weaknesses. With Wizards and Sorcery being incredibly vulnerable to 
 any kind of damage and the paladin and bard not really being fit to dish out damage. Therefore, classes work best within a party 
 to make up for their vulnerabilities. How this party is created is up to the player. You do not need other players to create a 
 party with D&D. All you need is 1 DM and 1 player. Although it is likely more fun to have more people to play with.
 </p>
 
 <p>
When you have selected a class for your character you then need to roll what is know as a hit-die(HP-die) to determine their hit-points.
 There are different kinds of hit-die depending on the class that has a number of different sides which could be a 1d6 (Sorcerer and Wizard),
 1d8 (Monk, Bard, Rogue, Warlock Druid, and Cleric), 1d10 (Ranger, Paladin, and Fighter) and 1d12 (Barbarian). 
 </p>
 
<p>
Each time your character levels up you will roll a hit-die + constitution modifier to increase your characters maxim health pool.
 Though the first-hit die you roll (at level 1) rolls its max number by default + constitution modifier. 
 </p><br/><br/>
 
 
 <h1>Magic</h1>
 <p>
 Finishing off with the basics we have magic. Almost all classes are capable of using magic in 
 some way. Of course, some classes are more suited than others when it comes to spell casting mainly. 
 You have full-casters (Wizard, Sorcerer, Bard, Cleric, Warlock,) and half-casters (Druid, Ranger, Paladin). 
 Technically Fighters and Barbarians can learn magic, but this only depending on their selected sub-classes, 
 but their still primarily physical damage dealers. 
 </p><br/>

 <p>
When casting the spell instead of rolling to see if the attack surpasses the targets AC, 
instead the target must make a dexterity saving roll (with a 1d20) in order to avoid the spell,
 getting hit if they fail and the spell missing if they succeed.  Some spells have it where the
 target will be hit regardless and instead, the target must make a dexterity saving roll in order
 to take half as much damage.
 </p><br/>

 <p>
Though not all spells just deal damage, there a variety of different 
spells that can debuff or buff a target, aid with rolls, or help with achieving a
 certain task (like growing fruit in less than a few seconds).
 </p>
 
<br/><br/>

<h1>Homebrew</h1>
<p>The world of D&D doesn't have to be confined to what is considered to be canon. 
If up for it and if the GM allows it, players can design their very own races, spells, items, 
and classes to use for their RPs. I myself typically like to RP this way, using the various races I come up with. 
However, keep in mind that when it comes to using homebrew to create the things mentioned, you should still endeavor to
 make it as fair possible. Trust me. You'll have more fun that way rather than creating some sort of powerhouse on the same 
 level as super man, which will definitely make the RP experience very unpleasant for everyone.</p><br/><br/>
	
<h1>One Last Thing</h1>
<p>
If you could already tell, I may have left a couple of things out. Honestly, you're better off looking up what each class,
 sub-class, and spell does and what sort of weapons there are. Because if I tried to explain that, this page would be 10 times 
 longer. And as I may have mentioned before, I'm still kinda new to the game and may have left out something without my knowing. Don't 
 let that discourage you, D&D 5e is simpler then it leads on and once you get the hang of it, it's up to you with either or not you'll
 come to really enjoy it as I have.
