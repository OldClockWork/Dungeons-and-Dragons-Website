	<h1 style="color:red">How I got into D&D Role-playing</h1>
	<br/><br/>
	<p>
	Before I started to get into D&D RPing. 
	I would just do free-style RPs, which is basically just coming up with plots out of the blue 
	and where anything could happen in the RP. In other words most of the time there wasn't really a
	plot planned, it was just go with the flow between two people. I've been RPing ever since I was a 
	teen and if I were to look back on those days I'd recoil in repugnance of just how terrible my writing was
	back then. But as I kept RPing did my skills in writing gradually improve, my paragraphs got longer, sometimes 
	they'd be big enough for a page, and I learned to make sentences a lot more detailed. Sometimes I wonder if my 
	writing would have been more horrid if I'd never gotten into RPing. Now, after what I think has been a solid 5 years (maybe even more than that), 
	I've become burnt out on doing free-style RP's. It was at that time I was slowly being introduced to the world of D&D role-playing and I'm 
	sure you'd ask how this is much different than the way I'd been playing in the past. I can't really explain the reason. Somehow RPing 
	just became fun for me again when it involved giving characters stats, rolling some dice to determine outcomes, and playing with more 
	than one person. Overall, I've come to really enjoy D&D RPing and hope after having a look through the site it will spark a bit of interest 
	in those who've taken the time to read through it.
