<p>
The world of D&D has a vast collation of different monsters to battle or for the DM to use. 
Much like the player character, monsters have their own unique stats, abilities, and actions to use. 
Monster also often have an alignment of their own which often determines what the creature is like, 
but ultimately that decision lies within the DM to decide. However, some monsters are unable to make moral choices and, 
therefore, are incapable of having an alignment. This is usually reserved for wild, non-sentient animals. 
Here I've gathered a number of different monsters that you may look over, all of which include the basic information mentioned above.
</p> <br/>

<h1>Challenge Rating</h1>
<br/>
<p>
All monster have what is know as a Challenge Rating (or CR for short) which determines just how difficult a monster is with the 
most dangerous monsters rocking a CR of 30 and the weakest/non-threatening having a CR of 0. 
This helps with determining with either or not characters are suited for facing against such potential 
threats depending on their level and the size of their party.</p>
<br/>
<p>
For example, it would take five level 1 player characters just to takedown 1 
giant hyena without to much trouble. And that only has a challenge rating of 1!
 Don't worry though there are much weaker monsters that can have a CR of 1/8, 1/4, or 1/2. 
 These level of monsters are more suited for a level 1 character. But, again, ultimately how troubling a monster is, 
 is left up to the DM to choose nor is a player restricted to using weak level 1 characters unless the DM says otherwise.
</p><br/>

<h1>Legendary Actions</h1>
<br/>
<p>
Standing out more from the crowd, are legendary monsters who have a special feature to them called Legendary Actions. 
What this does is allow the monster to perform an action even if it's not its turn, which can take the form of an attack from itself, 
its lair, or from the environment affected by it's very presense. This sort of action can only be executed once per other creatures turn, 
making creatures with this ability quite challenging to handle. Although, there are some legendary actions that require 2 or more other creatures to 
have taken their turn before another Legendary action can be performed.
